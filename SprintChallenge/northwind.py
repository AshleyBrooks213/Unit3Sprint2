Answer the following questions, baseline ~3-5
sentences each, as if they were interview screening
questions (a form you fill when applying for a job):
â€‹
- In the Northwind database, what is the type of
relationship between the `Employee` and `Territory` tables?
- What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB)
is appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
- What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?

"""

answer1 = "The relationship between the 'Employee' and 'Territory' tables \
            shows that each employee is responsible for a certain \
            territory or territories. \
            There is a column in Territory that has a short description \
            that you can read to see the details of each territory."


print(answer1)


answer2 = "A document store like MongoDB would be appropriate if \
            you were dealing with Big Data and needed the benefits \
            of horizontal scaling so it is not all done on one computer. \
            MongoDB is an object-oriented NOSQL database. So, it handles data \
            that is located in separate documents instead of in tables\
            like data stored in SQL databases."


print(answer2)


answer3 = "NewSQL is a way of using a relational database that has \
            characteristics of a SQL and a NOSQL database. \
            NewSQL tries to achieve the scalability of a \
            non-relational database and the guaranteed ACID \
            properties of a relational database."
